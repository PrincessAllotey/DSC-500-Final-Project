# Class Description
## DSC 500 Data Science Capstone
This fourth‐year course requires students to formulate and solve a significant data analytics problem in a domain other than data science, computer science, or mathematics. The course brings together students’ studies in data science and involves proposing a problem, developing an analytics plan, performing exploratory data analysis, preparing data for model building, modeling the data using appropriate data analytics tools, and analyzing and presenting results. Throughout the semester, students will work with a domain advisor with expertise in the problem area, as well as with the capstone instructor, who will help shepherd projects to completion and guide students to present their work effectively. The project will culminate in a final paper, oral presentation, and poster presentation. Guest speakers may be arranged to present on a variety of topics.

# DSC-500-Final-Project

# Project Description 
The Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease which was first discovered in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th March 2020. As of late August, there have been more than 23 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 with more than 800 thousand deaths. With the advent of COVID-19, there are many datasets on time series and indicator information on COVID-19. This project seeks to focus mainly on unstructured text data on previous or current COVID-19 patients. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, the primary goal is to develop a rigorous and reliable model that learns more about the eventual outcome (dead or recovered) of COVID-19 patients and serves as an efficient yardstick for predicting the eventual outcome of future COVID-19 patients.  
 

# Objectives  

The objectives of this project are: 

1. To examine up-to-date and unstructured text data for indicators of COVID-19  
2. To explore the possibility of predicting the outcome of future patients from current COVID-19 patient data  
3. To consider the potential for applicability in cases of triage practices for future COVID-19 patients  
4. To determine trends in specific COVID-19 patients over a stated period 


# Resources and Methods  

The primary dataset was obtained from the Outbreak and Pandemic Preparedness team of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. Data was also obtained from the WHO website and the Centre for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. The University of Michigan COVID-19 Datasets and Text Mining webpage was a secondary source for data.  

Datasets obtained contained time series and indicator data including age, sex, city, location, date of onset of symptoms, date of admission to the hospital, symptoms, travel history, reported market exposure, chronic disease information, outcome, and date of death or discharge. The primary dataset used had more than two million rows of data on COVID patients worldwide. Each row contains data on an individual COVID patient and provides times series data mainly on the date of onset of symptoms, date of discharge etc. The NLP tool used was the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).
